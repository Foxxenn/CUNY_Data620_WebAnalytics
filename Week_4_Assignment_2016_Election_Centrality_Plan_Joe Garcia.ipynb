    "This notebook outlines a proposed approach for analyzing network centrality measures using publicly available campaign finance data from the 2016 United States federal election. The objective of this assignment is to identify a suitable network dataset, define a meaningful graph structure, and describe how node level centrality measures specifically degree centrality could be used to predict outcomes for individual nodes. The dataset is sourced from the Federal Election Commission’s OpenFEC API and is well suited for network analysis because it captures contribution relationships between political committees and candidates, while also providing categorical attributes for nodes such as party affiliation. In accordance with the assignment requirements, this notebook serves as a planning and conceptual template; no data are loaded or models are estimated at this stage.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the 2016 election network, a realistic node-level outcome to predict for each candidate is Win vs. Lose (binary) or vote share (continuous). Using degree centrality—defined here as the number of unique committees that contributed to a candidate during the 2016 cycle—we would hypothesize that candidates with higher degree centrality are more likely to win because they demonstrate broader fundraising connectivity and support across the campaign-finance network (more distinct relationships rather than dependence on a few sources). Because each candidate has a categorical attribute (party: Democrat/Republican/Other), we would also expect the strength of this relationship to differ by party, since party fundraising structures can be organized differently (e.g., one party may have wider, more distributed committee support while another may be more centralized). The planned (future) comparison would be to first compare degree centrality distributions for Democrats vs. Republicans, and then fit a simple model such as Win ~ degree + party + degree:party to test whether degree centrality predicts winning overall and whether that predictive effect changes across party groups.\n",

By defining a clear network structure, identifying relevant node-level categorical variables, and outlining a hypothetical prediction task, this approach demonstrates how centrality measures can be used to study meaningful real-world outcomes such as electoral success. Although no data are analyzed at this stage, the framework established here provides a solid foundation for future implementation, enabling empirical evaluation of how fundraising connectivity and network position relate to candidate outcomes in political networks."
